            <h2 class="section-title">Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>Sam Altman was born on April 22, 1985, in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. He is the eldest of four children in a Jewish family; his mother was a dermatologist, and his father worked as a real estate broker.</p>
            <p>At the age of eight, Altman received his first computer, an Apple Macintosh, which sparked his interest in technology and coding. He attended John Burroughs School, a private preparatory school in Ladue, Missouri, where he excelled academically and participated in extracurricular activities such as debate club and math competitions.</p>
            <p>During his teenage years, Altman came out as gay. He publicly announced his sexuality during a school assembly and encouraged teachers to create supportive environments for LGBTQ+ students. This act was noted for its impact on the school's culture.</p>
            <p>In 2003, Altman enrolled at Stanford University to study computer science. After two years, he left Stanford to co-found Loopt, a location-based social networking application.</p>

This innovative concept attracted significant attention, leading to Loopt raising over $30 million in venture capital.</p>
                <p>Despite its pioneering approach, Loopt struggled to achieve widespread user adoption, facing stiff competition from emerging social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. In March 2012, the company was acquired by Green Dot Corporation for $43.4 million.</p>
                <p>While Loopt did not attain long-term success, the experience provided Altman with valuable insights into the startup ecosystem, product development, and the challenges of scaling a tech company. This foundation proved instrumental in his subsequent roles, including his leadership at Y Combinator and OpenAI.</p>
